## Description

My motivation for this project was: As a manager I want to be able to contruct a visual representation of my team.

I built this project because It allows me to have a styled html page of my team built for me based on my CLI inputs .

This project solves the following problem: Having to manually create the aforementioned page.

From this project I learnt I shouldn't try to assign instance properties asynchronously.
